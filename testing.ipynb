All Institutions (including Host and Partner Institutions) will be required to ensure \\nthat the expenditures are fundable, necessary and reasonable for the conduct \\nof the Research and verify claimed items with source documents, before \\nsubmitting the funds requisition to  Grantor.  \\n \\n2. A list of non -fundable direct cost items is provided in the  Annex . \\n \\n3. All expenditure should be incurred ( based on invoice or service rendered  date) \\nwithin the  Term1. \\n \\n4. In general,  prudence  should  be exercised  for all project  costs,  and expenditures \\nclaimed must comply with the Institutions’ internal procurement processes, \\nguidelines and  policies.  \\n \\n5. Grantor  reserves  the rights  to reject  any claims  that have  resulted  from changes \\nto Research without prior approval from Grantor and items found not to be \\nfundable, not necessary, not reasonable, not relevant or not used for the \\nResearch.  \\n \\nExpenditure of Manpower (EOM)  \\n \\n6. Fundin g of Research Personnel under the grant must comply with prevailing \\nand consistently applied human resource guidelines of the employing \\nInstitution(s).  \\n \\n7. This will extend to Institutions’ prevailing policies on associated human \\nresources costs (e.g. staff i nsurance, overtime claims, staff relocation, \\nemployment benefits, employment levy, employment pass, pre -examination \\nmedical check -up, housing allowance, service award and recruitment \\nassociated  cost).  \\n \\n8. All EOM related expenses shall be pro -rated taking ref erence from the project \\nstart date, except for lump -sum insurance claims, which shall be allowable as \\nclaimed. As a general principle, staff costs should be charged based on time \\ncommitment to the  Research.  \\n \\n9. Details of Research Personnel employed under the Funding must be provided \\nin the manpower  listing,  and continuously  updated,  including  new additions  and \\nthose whose employment have  ended.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 Expenditures related to on -boarding of research personnel may be supported before the start of Term, but \\nmust be made in accordance with the Institutions’ human resources policies and after the date in which the \\nGrantor receives the completed Acceptance Form.  Version 2.0 (with effect from 1 Jan 2020)  \\n2  \\n  \\n10. All Institutions must adhere to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment \\nPractices2. \\n \\n11. The Institution(s) are allowed to make manpower changes (i.e. \\nincrease/decrease in headcount, change in designation or scheme of hires, \\nchange  in time commitment  to the grant),  as long as the changes  are necessary \\nfor the Research, comply with the Institution(s)’ policies and does not exceed \\nthe EOM  vote.  \\n \\n12. Claims for staff performance bonus should be submitted within six (6) months \\nfollowing the end of the Term . For Host Institutions that practise accrual of \\nperformance  bonus,  balance  Funds  should  either  be returned  or claimed  within \\nsix (6) months if the pay -out comes after the end of the Term. In instances \\nwhere the end of the Term does not coincide with the regular annual appraisal \\ncycle, the Institution(s) will be allowed to submit a final performance bonus of \\nthe Research Personnel, based on the prevailing human resource policies  and \\npro-rated to the number of months of servi ce from the last appraisal of such \\nResearch Personnel to the end of the  Term.  \\n \\nEquipment (“EQP”)  \\n \\n13. The Institutions / Investigators shall ensure that the purchase of each \\nequipment is necessary for the Research or activity supported by the Funding \\nand is no t otherwise reasonably available and  accessible.  \\n \\n14. For high value equipment purchase, Investigators are required to update the \\nlist of equipment acquired, as part of the Yearly Progress Report submission. \\nGrantor may require the Institutions / Investigators  to allow approved Third \\nParties to access and use the equipment, subject to the availability of the \\nequipment.  \\n \\n15. The Institutions  are allowed  to make  changes  within  the EQP  vote (i.e. changes \\nin quantity and changes in equipment), provided that these changes are (i) \\nnecessary, relevant and used for the Research; (ii) do not constitute a change \\nin Research; and (iii) are kept within the approved equipment vote  budget.  \\n \\nOther Operating Expenses (“OOE”)  \\n \\n16. The Institutions  are allowed  to make  changes  within  the OOE  vote (i.e. changes \\nin quantity and changes in OOE items), provided that these changes are (i) \\nnecessary, relevant and used for the Research; (ii) do not constitute a change \\nto the Research; and (iii) are kept within the approved OOE vote  budget.  \\n \\nOverseas Travel (“OT”)  \\n \\n17. It is the responsibility of the Investigators / Institutions to ensure that all travel \\nexpenses are in line with the Institutions’ consistently applied policy on  travel.  \\n \\n \\n \\n2 Please refer to www.mom.gov.sg for details of the Fair Consideration Framework.  Version 2.0 (with effect from 1 Jan 2020)  \\n3  \\n  \\nThe Institutions are to ensure that any travel undertaken is in relation to the \\nResearch only and f or no other purpose.  \\n \\n18. The purpose of the travel should be directly relevant to the Research and \\nnecessary to accomplish the Research  objectives.  \\n \\n19. Virement of Funds into the OT vote is not  allowed.  \\n \\nResearch Scholarship (“RS”)  \\n \\n20. Postgraduate stipend must align with the prevailing rates set by the Ministry of \\nEducation. Postgraduate stipend and tuition support will not attract indirect \\ncosts.  \\n \\n21. Virement from RS vote to other budget category votes is not allowed , regardless \\nof variation  amount.  \\n \\nIndirect Cost s \\n \\n22. Indirect costs in research are those costs that are incurred for common or joint \\nobjectives and therefore cannot be identified readily and specifically with a \\nparticular sponsored research project, but contribute to the ability of the \\nInstitutions to su pport such research projects (e.g. providing research space, \\nresearch  administration  and utilities,  and not through  the actual  performance  of \\nactivities under the sponsored  projects).  \\n \\n23. The Grantor does not manage indirect cost funding. Investigators should refer \\nand adhere to their Institutions’ policy of managing indirect cost  funding.  \\n \\nVariations to the Research  \\n \\nVirement between Votes  \\n \\n24. Grantor delegates the approval authority for the virement of funds between  the \\nvotes to the Institut ion’s Director of Research (or equivalent), subject to a \\ncumulative amount not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the total project direct \\ncost value . \\n \\n25. For virements cumulatively above ten percent (10%), the approval authority \\nremains  with the Grantor.  Requests  for virement  should  be submitted  to Grantor \\nno later than three (3) months from the end of the  Term.  \\n \\n26. Retrospective  virement  requests  or late requests  to Grantor  will not be allowed, \\nunless there is compelling  justification.  Version 2.0 (with effect from 1 Jan 2020)  \\n4  \\n  \\n \\nGrant Extension  \\n \\n27. Request for no -cost grant extension should be made to the Grantor before the \\nlast six (6) months of the original end of the Term. Any variation requests \\nnecessary to meet the extension period must be made known as part of the \\nextension  request.  \\n \\n28. A one -off project extension should not be more than a total of six ( 6) months. \\nAn extension beyond six (6) months will require compelling  justification.  \\n \\nChange in Lead Principal Investigator/Investigators (Not applicable for Talent Awa rd) \\n \\n29. Grantor’s approval will be required for a change in the Lead Principal \\nInvestigator/Investigators.  \\n \\n30.

Funding  for private sector entities for research projects (of total project \\nbudget >$500,000), and test -bedding/demonstration/scale -up projects (of total project \\nbudget >$2M), will be conditional on collaboration with a public research performer  \\n• NEA, as the Implem enting Agency  (IA), will  determine which of the following two \\ncategories applies for the Research Innovation and Enterprise ( RIE) funding proposed \\nfor a private sector entity . \\nActivity  Broad definitions  \\nResearch  Refers to work undertaken that is (1) aimed at new findings; \\n(2) based on original, not obvious, concepts and hypotheses; \\nand (3) uncertain about the final outcome  \\n[References the OECD’s Frascati Manual (2015) definition for \\nR&D]  \\nTest-bedding/ \\ndemonstration/scale -\\nup  Includes work undertaken to (1) test existing \\nknowledge/capabilities in a laboratory/simulated environment \\nbefore it can be integrated into an operational system, (2) \\nvalidate and/or verify such knowledge/capabilities as part of a \\nproof -of-concept, or (3) build on such knowledge/capabilities \\nfor application on a larger scale.  \\n \\ni. As RIE funding should be directed at supporting public RIE ecosystem growth, the \\napplicant should provide strong justification for funding  research  activities undertaken \\nprimarily by private sector entities.  \\nii. For research projects, the condition will apply for projects with a total budget of > \\n$500,000  to ensure that public research performers are involved in such research \\nprojects for capability transfer, especially in research activities . \\niii. For test-bedding /demonstration/scale -up activities, the condition will apply for projects \\nwith a total budget of >$2M . In general, RIE funding for test -\\nbedding/demonstration/scale -up activities shoul d be focused on the deployment and/or \\ncommercialisation of public sector -developed capabilities . RIE funding should not be \\nused for test -bedding or deployment of off -the-shelf solutions, unless there is clear \\njustification of its benefit at the national or  RIE ecosystem level, e.g. would spur \\nwidespread/ national S&T adoption in line with RIE objectives, such as first use of a \\nnovel technology that could result in strong economic outcomes (e.g. significant cost \\nsavings) or drive widespread industry adoption  that would raise the sector’s competitive \\nadvantage . iv. For projects up to the $500,000  or $2M thresholds for research and test -\\nbedding/demonstration/scale -up activities  respectively , while no conditions will be \\nimposed on such projects, the applicant should  tap on, and involve public research \\nperformers in such projects as far as possible  to build skilled researcher pool . \\nS/N 1 – (b) Ensuring true collaborations with public research performers  \\n1b. For both research and test -bedding/demonstration/scale -up projects, collaborations \\nwith public research performers should be true partnerships  \\n• These collaborations should translate into new knowledge acquired by the RIE ecosystem \\nand/or growth in local abi lity to build on, scale up, or otherwise modify the resultant \\ncapability/system, i.e. it is not sufficient to train individuals/gov ernm ent agency teams to \\nbe smart users . \\n• NEA may support private sector applicants in identifying and linking up with suitable  public \\nresearch partners, e.g. IHLs (and the respective Innovation and Enterprise Offices (IEO) \\nand Centres of Innovation), A*STAR, and the CREATE entities . \\nS/N 1 – (c) Waiver from condition of collaboration with public research performers  \\n1c. If there are compelling reasons that preclude collaborations with public research \\nperformers, Applicants will need to provide NEA with the following information  for ass essment : \\ni. The basis for the deviation (e.g. national security/confidentiality issues)  \\nii. How RIE funding of the project will still accrue benefits to the public RIE \\necosystem even without collaboration with public research performers  \\n• This may include new knowledge acquired by the RIE ecosystem, \\nand/or growth in local ability to build on, scale  up, or otherwise modify \\nthe resultant capability/system (i.e. goes beyond training individuals/in -\\nhouse gov ernmen t agency teams to become smart users) . \\n• Could be demonstrated through meaningful KPIs with appropriately \\nambitious targets, e.g. no. of Researc h Scientists and Engineers ( RSEs ) \\nhired, no. of locals trained, no. of collaboration projects with local \\ncompanies, that would result in a local manpower pool that can build on, \\nscale up or modify the capability (see preceding point)  \\niii. The plan for mitigatin g the challenges that prevent collaboration with public \\nresearch performers  \\n• For example, if the lack of existing capability/expertise in the relevant \\nR&D area of work is the key challenge to involving public research \\nperformers in the current project,  the applicant  should articulate the plan \\nto grow local capability in the public research ecosystem and/or the \\nlocal RIE ecosystem . \\n• This will help seed capabilities that NEA can draw on in the future for \\ncapability development . \\n S/N 2 – (a) Prescribed funding s upport levels  \\n2a. Funding of private entities should be aligned with the support tiers indicated below.  \\nS/\\nN Type1 Max Direct Costs (DC)2 support  \\n1 All non -Singapore private sector entities (incl. \\nnot-for-profits)  30% \\n2 Large Local Enterprises (LLEs)  30% \\n3 Singapore SMEs  50% \\n4 Singapore Start -ups \\n5 Singapore Not -for-profits  \\n \\nS/N 2 – (b) Facilitating assessment of grant applications from private sector entities    \\n2b. Applicants should note the following regarding grant applications:  \\n• Private sector applicants are to provide financial statements/other justifications  as per \\nthe Additional Declaration Form for Private Sector Entities to determine which \\nenterprise segment the applicants fall into.  \\n• Budget line items should be suitably broken down for detailed analysis/ scrutiny, to \\nensure that the requested budget is fair and a good use of public monies  \\n \\nS/N 3 – (a) Funding for non -SG entities conditional on STLO appointment  \\n3a. A Singapore Technology Licensing Office (STLO) must be appointed in projects that \\nfund non -SG private sector entities, regardless of whether a public research performer is \\ninvolved in the p roject.   \\n• The STLO will help to manage the sponsored foreground  IP in Singapore for maximum \\nutility, and also help to provide fair access to SG entities in the public and private sector . \\n• The STLO will carry out IP management services, including responsibil ities and \\nobligations necessary to file, prosecute and/or protect the IP applications, manage and \\n \\n1 Definitions of each segment are included in Appendix  D.1.  \\n2 Definitions of Direct Costs (DC) reference those used in the guidelines on overhead support rates are in \\nAppendix D.2. Indirect costs will not be supported for all private sector entities (i.e. 0%  of indirect costs will \\nbe provided).  \\n license the sponsored IP minimally in Singapore (if required, services to manage IP \\noutside of Singapore can be set out in the project agreement) .  \\n• Unless exp licitly agreed with the owner(s) of the background IP, the STLO will have no \\nrights to manage background IP . \\n• Appointment of the STLO may be done on a fixed term (e.g. x months) . \\n• i.e. set out that the STLO has the right to commercialise the sponsored IP on \\nan exclusive basis and the sole right to issue exclusive and non -exclusive \\nlicenses of that sponsored IP for the specified term . \\n• Thereafter, the IP owner(s) may decide who will take over IP management \\nresponsibilities . \\n• NEA may support private sector entities in identifying and linking up with an appropriate \\nSTLO . \\n• IHL Innovation and Enterprise Offices ( IEOs ) and A*STAR may be appointed \\nto take on the role of STLO (a list of potential STLOs is in subsequent \\nparagraphs ). \\n• If a public research performer is involved, the natural STLO will be the IEO of \\nthat public research performer; otherwise, an STLO may be selected based on \\ntheir area of expertise .  \\n• NEAs may also identify other public/private sector entities to perform the role \\nof the STLO if deemed more appropriate; this will typically preclude the IP \\nlicensing arm of the private sector entity itself, since there could be pote ntial \\nconflict of interest (i.e. the company would have vested interest in not providing \\nfair access to the sponsored IP to other public/private sector entities) . \\n• As a general principle, funding of the STLO should not reduce grant funding to the \\nawarded en tity. \\n• NEA will work with the relevant STLO to assess the IP management costs, \\nwhich can be funded directly by NEA, or through the awarded entity (i.e. the \\nentity would receive the STLO funding as part of the grant, and pay the STLO \\naccordingly) . \\nList of po tential STLOs  \\n• NEA may consider appointing the Innovation and Enterprise Offices (IEO) within the \\nfollowing IHLs and RIs as STLO, in cases where RIE funding is provided to non -Singapore \\nprivate sector entities.  \\n• As there is no definitive list of each of the IEO’s strengths,  NEA may consider IEOs \\nthat had been engaged in the technology area (s) of interest. NEA may also  reach \\nout directly to the IEOs to assess if they would be appropriate as the STLO for the \\nproject . • NEA will need to reach out to the relevant IEO to enquire th eir interest in taking up \\nthe role as STLO . \\n• If necessary, NEA may also identify other public/private sector entities to serve as \\nSTLO . \\nTable: List of IEOs that could potentially serve as STLOs  \\nS/N Entity  \\n1 A*STAR (A*ccelerate)  \\n2 NUS (NUS Industry  Liaison Office)  \\n3 NTU (NTUitive)  \\n4 SMU (Office of Research and Tech Transfer)  \\n5 SUTD (T3 office or Technology Transfer & Translation under Office of \\nPartnership, Innovation & Enterprise)  \\n6 SIT (ARIE or Applied Research, Innovation & Enterprise division)  \\n7 Singapore Polytechnic (Department of Technology, Innovation and Enterprise)  \\n8 Ngee Ann Polytechnic (Technology Development and Innovation Office)  \\n9 Nanyang Polytechnic (Centre for Industry & Lifelong Learning, CIL3)  \\n10 Temasek Polytechnic (Research and Technology Development Department)  \\n11 Republic Polytechnic (Office of Technology Development)  \\n12 Institute of Technical Education (Industry -based Training Division, ITE HQ)  \\n13 National Health Innovation Centre  \\n \\n  Appendix D.1 \\nDefinitions of the different enterprise segments , caa 19 Jul 2021  \\nS/N Type  Criteria  \\n1 Non-Singapore \\nentities  • <30% local shareholding , determined by the ultimate \\nindividual ownership  \\n2 LLEs  • ≥30% local shareholding; and  \\n• More than $100M in annual turnover  \\n3 SMEs  • Have Group Annual Sales Turnover of not more than \\n$100M, or maximum employment of 200 employees  \\n• To qualify as an Singapore entity, they must also have at \\nleast 30% local shareholding, i.e. local equity held \\ndirectly or indirectly by Singaporean(s) and/or S ingapore \\nPermanent Resident (PR)(s)  \\n4 Start -ups • Registered for less than 5 years at time of grant \\napplication  \\n• Has individual ownership of more than 50% at reference \\nyear; and  \\n• Employs at least 1 worker  \\n• To qualify as an  Singapore entity, they must also have at \\nleast 30% local shareholding  \\n5 Not-for-profits  • Registered as a public Company Limited by guarantee, \\nsociety or charity trust  \\n• Main purpose is to support or engage in activities of \\npublic or private interest without  any commercial or \\nmonetary profit, and are prohibited from distributing \\nmonetary residual to their own members  \\n• To qualify as an Singapore not -for-profit, the entity must \\nmeet all 3 of the following criteria : (1) Registered and \\nphysically present in Singapore; (2) Core funding (i.e. \\nexcluding competitive grant funding) is derived \\nentirely/mostly from Singapore  entities; (3) Managed by \\na Board, which is at least half appointed by Singapore  \\nentities  \\n Appendix D.2 \\n \\nDefinition of direct costs  \\n• Direct Costs: Expenses directly attributed to the research/innovation & enterprise (I&E) \\nproject  (i.e. required to deliver project objectives).

Singapore , being a city -state, is faced with  an increasingly carbon - and \\nresource -constrained future  as well as  limited land for waste disposal . To guide the \\ntransit ion to a more sustainable and circular economy, the National Environment \\nAgency (NEA) has developed  the Zero Waste M asterplan with the vision of moving \\ntowards a Zero Waste Nation .  Packaging  waste, including  plastic s, was identified as \\none of the priority waste streams that Singapore will need to better manage.  \\n \\n2. Plastic recycling rates have remained low in Singapore , ranging between 4 % \\nand 6% from 2017 to 2022. To reduce waste generation and improve recycling rates  \\nof packaging waste , NEA  has introduced  various initiatives  such as the  National \\nRecycling Programme  (NRP) , Packaging Partnership Programme, the Mandatory \\nPackaging Reporting scheme , and the disposable carrier bag charge . Under the NRP, \\nmixed recyclables  are collected by dedicated recycling trucks and sent to Materials \\nRecove ry Facilities (MRF s) where the different types of recyclables are sorted, baled \\nand sent to local  and overseas recycling plants for further processing. NEA has \\nannounced  that a beverage container return scheme will commence from 1 Apr 2025.  \\n \\n3.   Plastic waste such as polyethylene Terephthalat e (PET) from the industrial \\nand commercial sector as well as PET beverage containers collected under the \\nbeverage container return scheme  can be mechanically recycled  into pellets or flakes \\nfor manufacturing new bottles or other products . This  reduces the amount of plastic \\nincinerated , and correspondingly the amount of carbon emitted from incineration  \\nplants in Singapore . Refer to Appendix 1  for the initiatives that NEA has \\nimplemented/planned to implement on plastic waste ma nagement.   \\n \\n4. To enhance Singapore’s plastics recycling efforts, NEA is pursuing chemical \\nrecycling solutions to close the plastic waste loop in Singapore. Chemical recycling \\ncan process plastics that cannot be mechanically recycled, such as contaminated \\nsingle-use plastics, and convert these into higher -value products such as new plastics \\nand chemicals.  While t here is currently no local facility that recovers contaminated \\nplastics from domestic waste , NEA is studying the feasibility of a Plastic Recovery \\nFacility which will take  in domestic waste collected from households and trade \\npremises, and recover various plastic polymer types ( e.g. polyethylene and \\npolypropylene) . These recovered plastics can then  be further treated in chemical \\nrecycling plants.  \\n \\n5. Beyond NEA’s existing and planned plastics recycling initiatives, there is a  need \\nto develop  novel solutions to address the resource sustainability challenges relating \\nto plastics. These include extracting value from other types of plastics present in mixe d \\nplastic waste, as well as developing sustainable plastic food packaging materials that \\nutilise recycled plastic materials that are easy to recycle.  \\n \\n  \\nSCOPE OF RFP  \\n6. This RFP is an open call for research and development ( R&D ) proposals to \\ndevelop novel solutions to complement NEA’s existing and planned plastics recycling \\nand recovery efforts. The  desired outcomes  for this open call are below . Applicants \\nmay submit one or more proposal(s) addressing one or more of these Outcome(s) .  \\n \\nDesired  Outcome A : Treatment and resource recovery of mixed plastic wastes not \\ncovered under NEA’s mechanical and chemical recycling plans.   \\n \\n7. While  NEA’s existing and planned recycling and recovery efforts will target the \\nmain types of plastics present in the blue recycling bins and domestic  waste , there \\nremains a sizeable amount of other types of plastic wastes that would not be \\nrecovered/removed from mixed  waste stream and would still be directed to the \\nincineration  plants. Recycling and recovery of these  non-targeted and rejected plastic \\nwaste streams could provide opportunities for resource recovery and diversion from \\nthe incineration plants. These include the following types of plastics:  \\n \\na) Plastic types not targeted under NEA’s current and planned  recyc ling \\nand recovery efforts  such as polyurethane (PU), polycarbonate (PC), \\nacrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)  \\nand multi -layer plastics  \\n \\nb) Contaminated1 mixed plastic waste such as  from MRF and rejected  \\nPET, PP , PE and other residu al plastic waste  from PRF   \\n \\n8. The primary objectives of the research proposal are as follows:  \\n \\na) Develop innovati ve solutions to recycle and convert any of the plastic waste \\ntypes  listed in para 7 (a) and (b) into marketable product(s) of dem and in \\nSingapore and/or overseas . \\n \\nb) Assess the lifecycle cost  and benefits  of the solution, recyclability of the end \\nproduct, potential environmental impact  such as leakage of microplastic into \\nthe environment during processing and in application  or usage of the end \\nproduct , net carbon emissions/abatement, generation of by -product, and \\nusage of energy, water  for the developed solution(s).  \\n  \\n \\n9. Proposal(s) shall include : \\n \\n• Assessment of  the tonnage of plastic waste that can potentially be  diverted \\nfrom i ncineration plants and estimated percentage contribution to nation’s \\nplastic recycling rate  if the solution is successful.  \\n \\n• An informed cost target of the solution the project aims to achieve.  \\n \\n1 Contaminati on refers to dirty plastic found with food (e.g. used and unwashed takeaway plastic food \\ncontainers) or liquid residues such as food remnants, cooking oil, milk, liquid detergent, etc.  \\n  \\n \\n• Assessment of the economic and other sustainability impact s to be derived \\nthrough the proposed solution(s).  \\n \\n• Industry partners willing to adopt/license the technology developed by \\nputting resources and funding into the project and finding off -takers for the \\nend-products.  \\n \\n• Substantiate the  demand for the processed  products and the amount of \\nplastics waste that would be utilised in the end -product.  \\n \\n10. Proposal(s)  shall exclude : \\n \\n• Mass -burn solutions i.e. incineration  \\n• Sorting , segregation,  and/or processing  of plastic waste for recycling, sale, \\nor export   \\n• Incorporation of plastic waste in construction applications like asphalt roads, \\nconcrete,  and pavements   \\n• Engineering modifications of commercially available solution(s) without any \\nresearch and development  such as reducing  the thickness of material or \\nreplacing one material with a  different material  \\n \\nDesired Outcome  B: Address emerging packaging trends to develop sustainable \\nplastic food packaging materials  that utilise recycled plastic materials  and are easy to \\nrecycle . \\n \\n11. In response to the global shift towards achieving higher recycling rates, \\ngovernments worldwide are implementing strategies to move towards upstream \\nsustainable practices. For example, the European Union (E U) commission proposed \\nthat all packaging within  the EU market should be economically viable for recycling  \\nand should contain a minimum percentage of recycled content (i.e., between 10% and \\n35% by 2030) recovered from post -consumer plastic waste, per unit of packaging .2 \\nConcurrently, fast moving consumer  goods  companies and brand owners are \\ndemonstrating their commitment by pledging to use recycled packaging materials for \\ntheir products. This has led to the increased trend  of making plastic packaging \\nmaterials made from recycled plastic , which also can be  easily recycle d, such as  use \\nof mono -layer polyolefin materials as replacement for hard to recycle multi -layered  \\nfilms.  \\n \\n12. Today the  use of mono -layer polyolefin packaging has already been introduced \\nlocally  for both food and non -food products . It is anticipated  that such stream s will \\nbecome more common as products with  mono -layer polyolefin packaging  would be \\nimported  into Singapore. This RFP looks for solution (s) to address the emerging trends \\nfor sustainab le packaging  and easy to recycl e solutions. The primary objectives of this \\nproposal are as follows:  \\n \\n2 Refer to “Regulation of the european parliament and of the council on packaging and packaging \\nwaste” . https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52022PC0677   \\n \\na) Develop solutions to enable the circularity of recycling mono -layer polyolefin \\npackaging  materials preferably back to food grade quality, while maintaining \\nthe necessary functionality, durability and aesthetic appeal required for food \\npackaging and ensure new packaging materials are made from recycled \\nmaterial with reference to minimum recycl ed content in plastic packaging \\nset by  EU.3 The developed solution should also meet  the food safety \\nstandard/regulation (i.e. all food contact articles must not transfer harmful \\nsubstances to the food coming into contact with them),  be able to retain the \\nfreshness and quality of food over extended periods, and provide a cost \\ncompetitive option to commercial packaging options. While there are no \\ninternationally harmoni sed standards/guidelines for the use of recycled \\nplastics in food contact articles at the moment , applicants could refer to the \\nUnited States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) - Use of Recycled \\nPlastics in Food Packaging (Chemistry Considerations): Guidance for \\nIndustry4 or the relevant EU regulations (e.g. EU 2022/16165 or EU \\n10/20116) as a guide.  \\n \\nb) Assess the  recyclability of the newly developed packaging materials, as well \\nas the environmental impact, lifecycle cost and waste reduction potential \\nresulting from adopting the developed packaging materials  at scale .  \\n \\n13. Proposal(s) shall include : \\n \\n• Industry partners contributing  resources and funding into the project and to \\npilot and implement developed packaging materials or adopt/license the \\ntechnology developed  \\n \\n• Justifications to showcase the substantial demand for the  products  \\n \\n• An informed cost target of the packaging material to be developed.  \\n \\n14.

Successful proposals will be notified in writing.  \\n \\n   \\nAppendix 1: Summary of the initiatives implemented/to be implemented on \\nplastic waste management.  \\n \\nA) National Recycling Programme   \\nUnder the NRP, Public Waste Collectors (PWCs) licensed by NEA are required to \\nprovide recycling bins and recycling collection services to all HDB estates, private \\nlanded properties and condominiums/private apartments opted into the public \\nwaste collection scheme . \\n \\nThe NRP adopts a collection system in which paper, plastic, glass and metal \\nrecyclables are deposited into the same b lue recycling bin for collection by the \\nPWCs. The mixed recyclables are collected by dedicated recycling trucks and sent \\nto Materials Recovery Facilities (MRF) where the different types of recyclables are \\nsorted, baled and sent to local/overseas recycling plants  for further processing .   \\n \\nAs part of Recycle Right Campaign and t o support Singapore’s ongoing efforts to \\nmake recycling convenient for households,  the Bloobox (recycling box) initiative \\nwas launched in March 2023. From 19 March to 30 April 2023,  all residential \\nhouseholds in Singapore could collect a Bloobox from vending machine s located \\nislandwide to  encourage the habit of recycling and set up a recycling corner at \\nhome . Labels are featured on the Bloobox  to help househ olds identify recyclable \\nitems.  \\n \\nB) Packaging Partnership Programme  \\nThe Singapore Manufacturing Federation partnered NEA to introduce an industry -\\nled programme called the Packaging Partnership Programme (PPP) in 2020. The \\nobjectives are to:  \\n \\na. Raise industry an d community awareness on reuse, reduce and recycle \\n(3R) of packaging waste; and   \\nb. Build up industry capability to reduce, recover and recycle packaging waste; \\nintroduce supply chain initiatives that foster the sustainable use of resources \\nin packaging.  \\n \\nC) Mandatory Packaging Reporting  (MPR)  scheme  \\nMandatory reporting of packaging data and 3R plans for packaging commenced in \\nJan 2021 and companies were required to submit their packaging reports by 31 \\nMarch 2022. Producers of packaged products suc h as brand owners, \\nmanufacturers, and importers, as well as retailers such as  supermarkets, are \\nrequired to report data on the packaging that they introduce into Singapore \\nannually. They also need to develop and submit plans to reduce, reuse or recycle \\npackaging in Singapore. For a start, the requirements apply to companies with an \\nannual turnover of more than $10 million. The MPR scheme aims to bring greater  \\nawareness to companies on the potential benefits for packaging reduction within \\ntheir business oper ations and to spur companies to reduce packaging and \\npackaging waste including plastic. It also lays the foundation for an Extended \\nProducer Responsibility scheme for packaging waste.   \\n \\nD) Disposable Carrier Bag Charge at Supermarkets   \\nA disposable carrier b ag charge was implemented on 3 Jul 2023 where  large \\nsupermarket operators are required to charge a minimum of five cents for each \\ndisposable carrier bag provided for purchases at physical stores, and to publish \\ninformation on the number of bags issued, amount of proceeds received from the \\nbag charge, and how the proceeds are used. The requirements apply to operators \\nof SFA -licensed supermarkets with an annual turnover of more than S$100 million . \\n \\nE) Beverage Container Return Scheme  \\nThe beverage container return scheme  is the first phase of an Extended Producer \\nResponsibility  approach to manage packaging waste, including plastics. Under the \\nscheme, pre -packaged beverages in plastic and metal container s ranging from 150 \\nmillilitres to 3 litres will have a refundable deposit of 10 cents. Consumers can claim \\na full refund of the deposit by returning their empty beverage containers at \\ndesignated return points. The scheme  aims to increase the recycling rate  of \\nbeverage containers, reduce the amount of waste disposed of, and reduce carbon \\nemissions. The scheme also seeks to raise consumer awareness on the \\nimportance of the 3Rs and encourage good recycling practices.  \\n \\nF) Plastic Recovery Facility (PRF)  \\nPRF is critical in anchoring the chemical recycling value chain in Singapore as it \\nwill recover the suitable plastic (e.g., Polypropylene (PP) and Polyethylene (PE )) \\nfrom domestic  waste to be used as feedstock for chemical recycling .
