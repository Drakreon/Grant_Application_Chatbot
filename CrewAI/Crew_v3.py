    <Reference>
    Reference 1 
    Query : Please advise what is the maximum project value? It is not stated in the RFP.It would be good to know so that our PIs can prepare accordingly. For example, our PIs prepare a $10M proposal but NEA is really looking out for a $3M proposal.  It would be more efficient for everyone including NEA if our PIs know the limit so that they can scope the project accordingly
    Output: There is no set cap per project and is subject to the reasonableness of the project budget. Applicants shall submit proposals according to the scope of the grant call indicated in the RFP document and request for budget according to their proposed study while ensuring that the requested budget is reasonable. Proposals will be evaluated based on the evaluation criteria such as the reasonableness of the proposed budget relative to the scope of the proposal
    Reference 2:
    Query: Would NEA reject proposals directly (especially for Desired Outcome B) if the application does not have an industrial partner?
    Output: NEA will evaluate the applications accordingly based on the Evaluation Criteria. The extent of having industry partners’ commitment and involvement in proposals will be viewed more favourably compared to those that do not have. 
    Reference 3:
    Query: If we choose to apply this FI as HI, can we collaborate with other polytechnics as well? 
    Output:Yes. There will be a need to identify a Host Institution for the applicant of the grant. “Host Institution” refers to the body or institution or administering organisation named in the Letter of Award as the “Host Institution” as the body responsible for undertaking and managing the Research. The Host Institution shall be responsible for administering and co-ordinating all matters relating to the Research, use of the Funds, communications with Grantor, and reporting requirements for and on behalf of all the Institutions. Please refer to Annex C.1, Clause 4.2 and 4.3 in particular, for the responsibilities of the Host Institution.
