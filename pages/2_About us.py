Responding to grant applicants' queries consumes about **10% of our work time** during grant call periods. We see an opportunity to leverage 🤖**Large Language Models (LLMs)** to develop an intelligent chatbot, designed to provide **consistent, accurate, and immediate** responses to queries.

The chatbot will learn, adapt, and improve over time, ensuring every interaction is better than the last. Future expansions may include support for all NEA-managed grant calls.

        Project focuses on building a custom chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology with Crew AI Agents to answer a variety of questions about grant calls and application processes. Here’s a breakdown of the key development areas:

        📑 **Step 1: Data Extraction and Forming of Vector Database from Grant Call Documents**:
                          
        - Extracting and combining text from grant call documents   
        - Text splitting and conversion to Vector Database
            
            
        ⚙️ **Step 2: Evaluation and Selection of LLM**:
                          
        - Fine-tuning parameters of vector database such as chunk size to improve accuracy and efficiency           
        - Using RAGAS to select the best retrieval combination (refer to more details in assessment section)
                          
        🔐 **Step 3: LLM Safety and Accuracy Assurance**:
                          
        - Integrating Crew AI agents for safe and reliable information retrieval. The four Crew AI are   
            (a) **Query filter** - Differentiate malicious query from query related to grant applicaiton   
            (b) **Query Rephraser** - Assess of the query is clear and provide edits ONLY when needed   
            (c) **Query Retriever** - Retrieve the data from the vector database   
            (d) **Response Generator** - Generate civil servant format of response based on reference provided
                          
        Prevent malicious content generation, ensure information accuracy and generate responses are replied in civil servant tone
             
        🛠️ **Step 4: Quality Assurance and Testing**:
                          
        - Testing chatbot responses across various query types           
        - Validating performance on complex and nuanced questions (refer to more details in assessment section)          
        - Enhancing relevance by incorporating historical FAQs

    st.write('''
    Our primary goal is to create an **AI-powered chatbot** that efficiently handles grant-related queries, **reducing staff time** spent on routine inquiries from **10% to 5%** during grant call periods. We aim to provide:

    - **Consistent, accurate, and instant** responses to applicants
    - **Improved efficiency** in the grant application process
    - A **scalable solution** with potential future use across all NEA-managed grants

    st.write('''
    For this Proof of Concept (POC), we are using data from a recently closed plastic grant call.

    **Key Data Sources:**
    - 📄**Grant-specific documents**: Consist of 12 documents covering the grant call topics, application process, eligibility criteria, proposal template, and evaluation matrix, etc.
    - ❓**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**: This is a document where we compiled the questions that were asked and answers provided. It was used during the evaluation of the chatbot to select the retrieval method (during RAGAS ).
    The document would be eventually incorporated into the chatbot at our final step as a data source to improve response quality
             
    In a production environment, we have tested codes which can scrape NEA Grant call webpages for real-time updates of documents. For now, the POC uses locally stored grant documents to ensure reliable processing.''')
