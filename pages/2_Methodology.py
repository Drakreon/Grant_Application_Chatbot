This project adopts a structured workflow, starting with data extraction and the creation of a vector database from grant call
documents. To ensure safety and reliability, Crew AI agents are integrated to handle query filtering, rephrasing, data retrieval,
and response generation.

The **left flowchart** illustrates the core chatbot process ðŸ¤–, beginning with the userâ€™s query. The query undergoes an initial
filter to block malicious content, followed by refinement through a rephrasing agent. The refined query is then used by the
retriever agent to search the vector database for relevant information. The response generator crafts a final reply using either
the rephrased query or the retrieved data, which is ultimately presented to the user.

The **right flowchart** provides an overview of the backend processes ðŸ’¾, including embedded model operations and data retrieval.
It outlines how data, such as information from previous grant calls, is scraped, processed, and stored as vector
representations in the database. When a query is received, Crew AI agent retrieve matching vectors and forward them
to the response generator, which, as shown in the left flowchart, produces the final output.
