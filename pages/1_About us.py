Responding to grant applicants' queries consumes about **10% of our work time** during grant call periods. We see an opportunity to leverage ü§ñ**Large Language Models (LLMs)** to develop an intelligent chatbot, designed to provide **consistent, accurate, and immediate** responses to queries.

The chatbot will learn, adapt, and improve over time, ensuring every interaction is better than the last. Future expansions may include support for all NEA-managed grant calls.

        Project focuses on building a custom chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology with Crew AI Agents to answer a variety of questions about grant calls and application processes. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the key development areas:

        üìë **Step 1: Data Extraction and Forming of Vector Database from Grant Call Documents**:
                          
        - Extracting and combining text from grant call documents   
        - Text splitting and conversion to Vector Database
            
            
        ‚öôÔ∏è **Step 2: Evaluation and Selection of LLM**:
                          
        - Fine-tuning parameters of vector database such as chunk size to improve accuracy and efficiency           
        - Using RAGAS to select the best retrieval combination (refer to more details in "Evaluation of Retrieval Method and Chatbot" section)
                          
        üîê **Step 3: LLM Safety and Accuracy Assurance**:
                          
        - Prevent malicious content generation, ensure information accuracy and generate responses are replied in civil servant tone
        - Integrating Crew AI agents for safe and reliable information retrieval. The four Crew AI are   
            (a) **Query filter** - Differentiate malicious query from query related to grant applicaiton   
            (b) **Query Rephraser** - Assess of the query is clear and provide edits ONLY when needed   
            (c) **Query Retriever** - Retrieve the data from the vector database   
            (d) **Response Generator** - Generate civil servant format of response based on reference provided           
        
             
        üõ†Ô∏è **Step 4: Quality Assurance and Testing**:
                          
        - Testing chatbot responses across various query types           
        - Validating performance on complex and nuanced questions (refer to more details in "Evaluation of Retrieval Method and Chatbot" section)          
        - Enhancing relevance by incorporating historical FAQs

    Our primary goal is to create an **AI-powered chatbot** that efficiently handles grant-related queries, **reducing staff time** spent on routine inquiries from **10% to 5%** during grant call periods. We aim to provide:

    - **Consistent, accurate, and instant** responses to applicants
    - **Improved efficiency** in the grant application process

    For this Proof of Concept (POC), we are using data from a recently closed plastic grant call.

    **Key Data Sources:**
    - üìÑ**Grant-specific documents**: Consist of 12 documents covering the grant call topics, application process, eligibility criteria, proposal template, and evaluation matrix, etc.
        - Request For Proposal Plastic Waste Recycling And Packaging Solutions
        - Instructions and Templates for Applicants_CTRL-plastic waste
        - Research Proposal Template
        - CV template

        - Annex G Check-List Of Documents To Prepare
    - ‚ùì**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**: This is a document where we compiled the questions that were asked and answers provided. It was used during the evaluation of the chatbot to select the retrieval method (during RAGAS ).
    The document would be eventually incorporated into the chatbot at our final step as a data source to improve response quality
             
    In a production environment, we have tested codes which can scrape NEA Grant call webpages for real-time updates of documents. For now, the POC uses locally stored grant documents to ensure reliable processing.''')

    :red-background[**Evaluation 1: Evaluation of splitting and chunking methods**]
             
    We evaluated three splitting and chunking methods using RAGAS metrics based on five past queries and answers:
    - Recursive + Na√Øve retrieval
    - Semantic + Na√Øve retrieval
    - Recursive + Parent and Child + Na√Øve retrieval
             
    Although the Semantic + Na√Øve Retrieval combination achieved the highest scores in Answer Relevancy (0.9416) and Correctness (0.4699), it generated the most hallucinations, raising concerns about reliability. This is a critical concern, as hallucinations can lead to misinformation and reduce the reliability of the system.
     
    **We chose the Recursive + Na√Øve Retrieval method for the following reasons:**
    - Reduced hallucinations: Compared to the Semantic method, the Recursive combination produces fewer hallucinations, ensuring better answer integrity.
    - Balanced approach : While not the top scorer, it offers solid results with a Relevancy score of 0.7376. It also provides decent results across all metrics
    
    This chosen combination aligns with our goal of providng accurate and reliable information by balancing performance in relevancy with minimal hallucination risk.

    :red-background[**Evaluation 2: Manual Evaluation of Output from Chatbot**]
             
    The refined evaluation process for crew agent outputs involves selecting a diverse set of historical questions categorised by difficulty:
    easy, moderate, difficult and queries that are not present in the database. The queries were run through the chatbot three times to assess consistency.
    The generated answers are then compared to pre-existing 'gold standard' answers. Understanding this evaluation process will help us refine our data and
    improve our methodologies for future developments.
             
    The results shows that the model faced some challenges especially in answering the harder queries with accuracy dropping to 50%. However it
    managed to provide decent control of hallucination and intepretation of data extracted.
